<!-- Note: For the extension to work properly, you'll need to convert these SVG files to PNG format -->
<!-- You can use any online SVG to PNG converter or image editing software -->
<!-- 
To create proper icons:
1. Save the SVG files as PNG with the correct dimensions (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
2. Or replace these with your own custom icons
3. The manifest.json references .png files, so make sure to convert them

For now, you can rename these files to .png and they should work in most browsers,
but proper PNG icons are recommended for production use.
